GoogleMap AngularJS Directive
=============================

There is already [one](https://github.com/nlaplante/angular-google-maps) for this.
However, I found myself doing totally different approach for this purpose than the existing one, such as;
  
  1. Everything in tag and attributes  
     Therefore, basic users does not even have to know what Javascript is. Tag does it all.

  2. Expose the original Google Maps V3 api  
     By doing so, programmers don't need to learn this module.
  
There is a blog that introduces this module.   
The title of it is '[Google Map As The Simplest Way](http://allenhwkim.tumblr.com/post/70986888283/google-map-as-the-simplest-way)'

To Get Started
---------------

 1. include ng-map.js or ng-map.min.js and ngMap module to be active. 
    
  <pre>
  &lt;script src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false">&lt;/script>
  &lt;script src="http://code.angularjs.org/1.2.5/angular.js">&lt;/script>
  &lt;script src="http://rawgithub.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps/master/dist/ng-map.min.js">&lt;/script>
  </pre>


 2. name angular app as ngMap, or add it as a dependency   
 
    `<html ng-app="ngMap">`

 3. use `map` tag, and optionally, `marker`, and `shape` tags  
 
    <pre>
    &lt;map style="display:block;height:300px" />  
    </pre>

Examples
--------

  * [Markers](https://rawgithub.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps/master/examples/marker.html)

  * [My Address](https://rawgithub.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps/master/examples/marker_with_address.html)
  * [Where am I?](https://rawgithub.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps/master/examples/marker_with_current_position.html)
  * [Controls](https://rawgithub.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps/master/examples/map_control.html)
  * [Map Options](https://rawgithub.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps/master/examples/map_options.html)
  * [Shapes(Rectangle, Triangle, Image)](https://rawgithub.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps/master/examples/shape.html)
  * [Events](https://rawgithub.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps/master/examples/events.html)
  * [Bird Eyes View/Street View](https://rawgithub.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps/master/examples/bird_eyes_and_street_view.html)
  * [Multiple Maps On A Page](https://rawgithub.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps/master/examples/multiple_maps_on_a_page.html)
  * [Index of Examples](https://rawgithub.com/hamzaazeem/angularjs-google-maps/master/examples/index.html)

To use it in your app, please include 'ngMap' as dependency.

   `var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngMap']); `
   `<html ng-app="myApp">`


You will also have these three scope variables after these directives are initialized.

    * $scope.map
    * $scope.markers as a hash
    * $scope.shapes as a hash

Directives
-----------
There are three directives defined with ng-map module.
  1. map
  2. marker
  3. shape

#### **map** Tag(Directive) ####


[As documented](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MapOptions),
it requires minimum two options, center and zoom. You can specify all map options as attributes.

These are attributes of map tag which is EXACTLY the same as the documentation.

<table>

<tr><td>background-color <td> i.e. 'yellow', 'red'
<tr><td>center<td>address or latitude/langitude<br/>   
                  i.e. center="[40.79,-54,18]", center="toronto, canada"
<tr><td>disable-default-u-i <td> true or false
<tr><td>disable-double-click-zoom <td> true of false 
<tr><td>draggable           <td> true of false
